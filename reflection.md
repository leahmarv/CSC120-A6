- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?
I think that Inheritance will make it much easier to make more complicated programs. Not having to repeat the same method for classes that are similar but still require different methods and attributes will save a lot of time. Additionally, I think that it helps me visualize the structure of Java as a whole now that I understand that every class in Java inherits from the Java class. It helps me to understand more of the terms used in the typically main Java file.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?
This assignment was very straightfoward. It was helpful to follow the instructions in the order they were given and to focus on the Cafe, House, and Library class one at a time. I would recommend that future students write out the names and parameters for every method in each class, respectively, then go back and fill in the actual code for the methods. This makes it easier to keep track of all the methods you add and ensures you don't skip any. Coming up with a working version of each class before addressing small bugs made it this assignment feel more manageable.

One problem that I was not able to fix was the error message saying `The value of the field House.hasDiningRoom is not used. This confuses me because there are multiple times that I use the value of the hasDiningRoom boolean variable in my House class.
